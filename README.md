# My personal projects folder (for Angular ts)
studies, activities and more trash I made while I learn

## How to navigate
- I'll make a README.md for each project (eventually)
- Whenever I lose interest in one of them I'll send them to the gulag ("Droped" folder)

## Rules
- you're alowed to pull, use, modify and deploy any of my proyects, just don't blame me if they break and warn me if I left my private keys and info in them by accident
- Also my code doesn't have lisense of any kind, I don't know how to make them free of copyright, yet...
